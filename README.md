- 👋 Hi, I’m @Blackness33348, which obviously isn't my real name
- 👀 I’m interested in learning basic coding languages (js, python, that type of stuff)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something really basic
- 📫 How to reach me... on second thought, please don't, I'm not great with people.

does anybody read these? I know they say "README", but it still seems somewhat odd.
